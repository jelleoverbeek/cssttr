# Introduction
This is a school project where the goal was to style a website using other selectors then classes and id's. This way we learned a lot about all the selectors in CSS. The site should be accessible using a keyboard while maintaining a pleasurable experience.

### CSS Secrets
Added some css secrets to a seperate file because it made no sense to add them to the main site:
https://jelleoverbeek.github.io/cssttr/csssecrets.html

* (Pseudo)random backgrounds
* Extended clickable area

All other css secrets are used somewhere in the site.
